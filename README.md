## Overview

Spectrum is a progression and exploration-based magic mod where you combine colors to create magical tools and machines,
with the ultimate goal of discovering what lies beneath the once-impenetrable Bedrock floor.

In the process, you will gain a new perspective and knowledge of things that have always been around you. Things you
have always noticed as being out of place, but have never been able to put your finger on because you have lacked the
knowledge and tools to observe them. Now is the time!

Spectrum is progression-based and tries not to give everything away at first glance.
Your journey through its advancement trees will be cluttered by realizations, puzzles and lots of "aaaaaah"s.
Each step of your journey will be hinted at through advancements and the in-game guidebook you receive as soon as you
find your first geode.

There is no hand-holding, so everything will require a fair bit of experimentation or exploration.
This also means that it may not be the best fit for everyone. Everyone plays Minecraft differently and that is perfectly
fine!

**_Spectrum is not meant to be rushed or grinded through. It is best played alongside your playthrough._**

## Revelations

Just because something looks like stone doesn't mean it is...

There is a lot to uncover and lots of discoveries to be made.

## Is this mod for me?
**You might enjoy Spectrum if you like the following:** Outer Wilds; Myst; Thaumcraft; Chromaticraft; figuring out how
and why things work

**You will probably hate Spectrum if you like the following:** Generic tech mod #7 with linear progression that tells
you exactly what to do at every step; following video tutorials 1:1

# Progressing through the mod

You may notice that most items only show up with a locked recipe in your recipe viewer.
In Spectrum, recipes and their matching guidebook entries are unlocked step by step, giving you something new to toy
with, with each new discovery you made.

Everything will be hinted at via advancements and the guidebook gifted to you when you stumble upon your first geode:
your own, personal notebook.
Everything you stumble upon, every recipe you unlock, every discovery you make you will note there.

## New ways to craft

Spectrum features lots of new ways to express yourself.
Its multiblock structures are designed in a way to feel satisfying, fun to play with and to give you the opportunity to
express your creativity by giving you lots of freedom on how to construct and personalize them.
