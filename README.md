## Overview
Spectrum is a storydriven, exploration-focused magic mod focusing on the natural energies that flow in the world,
represented in color.

Spectrum is progression based and tries to not give everything away at first glance. Every step in your journey through
the mod will be hinted at via advancements and the ingame guidebook that you will be gifted as soon as you start the
mod.

There is no hand-holding, so everything will require a fair bit of experimentation or exploration. That also means may
not be the best fit for every play style. Everyone plays Minecraft differently and that is perfectly OK!

# Progressing through the mod
Find your first gemstone geode to get started! Everything else is hinted at via advancements and the guidebook gifted to you. You can find all details that you need to know in Spectrums Guidebook that is given to you the first time you find gemstone shards. 

**_Spectrum is not meant to be rushed. It is best played alongside your playthrough._**
