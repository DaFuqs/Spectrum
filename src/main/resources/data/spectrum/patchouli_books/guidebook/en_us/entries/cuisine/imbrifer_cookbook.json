Crawfish Cocktails are deceiving, they seem simple, but to truly master them takes finesse and practice. It is possible to flamb√© the peaches and spices to make a sweet, syrupy, spicy sauce without cooking the crawfish, but it demands an immense amount of care. I use this to filter new students."

This will not just kill any parasites in the fish, but also cure the cake, giving it its signature pink colour."
