And yet, for all those reasons and more, the soft, warm glow of the gel elicits endless curiosity. All things are drawn to the flame. There is no question that what is effectively a high yield magical explosive bears endless potential. All you need is a little care, a small mountain of it, and a hint of reckless abandon."
